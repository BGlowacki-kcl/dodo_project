## About the Project

Joborithm is an innovative job hiring platform that combines modern UI/UX design with machine learning technology to create an intuitive job matching experience. The platform features a swipe-based interface for job seekers, AI-powered resume parsing, intelligent job matching using pre-trained models, and code assessment capabilities for employers.

## Project Website

Visit our website: [link.com](https://dodoproject22-03.vercel.app/)

## Features

- **Swipe-Based Job Matching**: Intuitive interface for job seekers to browse and apply to relevant positions
- **AI Resume Parser**: Powered by LLama 3.2 model to automatically extract information from candidate resumes
- **Intelligent Job Matching**: Integration with JobBERT v2 for accurate job recommendations
- **Code Assessment System**: Time-constrained coding challenges with visible and hidden test cases
- **Firebase Authentication**: Secure user authentication and management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BGlowacki-kcl/dodo_project.git
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Environment setup:
   
   **Backend (.env file in backend directory)**:
   ```
   TODO
   ```
   
   **Frontend (.env file in frontend directory)**:
   ```
   TODO
   ```

## Running the Application

### Backend Server

```bash
(Root folder)
npm run dev
```

The backend will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend Server

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Testing

### Backend Tests

Our backend uses Jest for testing API endpoints, controllers, and in-memory database interactions.

```bash
(Root folder)
npm test
```

Coverage for these tests will be displayed in the CLI terminal after all tests run, along with the number of all tests and their status. The screenshot of coverage is also attached to the report.

### Frontend Tests

Our frontend tests utilize React Testing Library and Vitest to ensure correct UI behavior, component rendering, and user interactions. Coverage for these tests are attache to the report.

```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

### Black-box Functional Tests

Our project consists of multiple functional tests utilizing Cypress. These tests ensure the correct end-to-end working of the application and tests functionality that normally would be technically hard to test. 

```bash
cd frontend
npm test:e2e
```

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, Vite.js, Material UI, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication
- **ML Models**: 
  - JobBERT v2 (Hugging Face) for job matching
  - LLama 3.2 (3B parameters) for resume parsing
- **Deployment**:
  - Frontend: Vercel.com
  - Backend: Render.com
  - Database: MongoDB Atlas

## Architecture

Joborithm follows a modular architecture with separate layers for:

1. **Frontend**: User interface and client-side logic
2. **Backend**: API endpoints, business logic, and integration with third-party services
3. **Database**: MongoDB collections for users, job postings, applications, code assessments, code submissions, and shortlists.

## ML Components

### Job Matching Algorithm

The platform utilizes the JobBERT v2 model from Hugging Face for job matching. This pre-trained model analyzes job seeker profiles and job postings to provide a ranked list of suitable matches, which are then presented in the swipe interface.

### AI CV Parser

The CV parsing functionality uses LLama 3.2 model with 3B parameters. The process involves:

1. Extracting text from PDF resumes
2. Passing the text to the LLM
3. Generating structured JSON output with relevant information
4. Pre-populating profile forms with the extracted data
